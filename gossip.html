        <p>Lara is untrustworthy, I wouldnt trust her with as far as I could throw her. - Aaron Dietz </p>
        
        <p>Lara is the best person to lay on the couch and watch Game of Thrones with. Especially when she asks questions about the lore and seems to care when she probably doesn't. - Abby Small </p>

        <p>Lara is very energetic and social. Sometimes she annoys me, but we get along for the most part :). - Ely Toledo</p>

        <p>Lara is the such a loyal, sweet, and one of a kind person. She is so stylish, always speaks her mind and overall cool as fuck. - Valeria Caballero</p>

        <p>Lara always makes a point to talk to me even when no one else does, which says a ton about her as a person. - James Herrgsell</p>
        
        <p>Lara has her big bowl of BASTA and with potatos and other random stuff in it. It smells sometimes, but it just makes her all that more intertesting and lovable. - Hasti Khaksari</p>

        <p>Lara makes me feel special and happy when I'm at my lowest. - Natasha Panepinto</p>
       
        <p>Lara is literally way more gay than she lets on. She flirts with me evey time shes even slightly tipsy...the back scratches are appreciated tho. - Samia Juras</p>
        
        <p>Lara is a kind friend who always makes me feel heard. I love spending time with her! - Tessa Montgomery</p>
