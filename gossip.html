        <p>Lara is very energetic and social. Sometimes she annoys me but we get along for the most part :). - Ely Toledo</p>

        <p>Lara is the best person to lay on the couch and watch Game of Thrones with. Especially when she asks questions about the lore and seems to care when she probably doesnt. - Abby Small </p>

        <p>Lara is the such a loyal, sweet, and one of a kind person. She is so stylish, always speaks her mind and overall cool as fuck. - Valeria Caballero</p>

        <p>Lara is untrustworthy, I wouldnt trust her with as far as I could throw her. - Aaron Dietz </p>

        <p>Lara always makes a point to talk to me even when no one else does, which says a ton about her as a person - James</p>
        
        <p>Lara makes me feel special and happy when Im at my lowest - Natasha</p>
       
        <p>Lara is literally way more gay than she lets on. she flirts with me evey time shes even slightly tipsy... the back scratches are appreciated tho. - Samia</p>
