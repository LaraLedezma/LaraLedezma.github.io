                <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        
                <p>I am a constantly curious <em>senior</em> at the University of Colorado Boulder working towards a degree in Advertising with a minor in Creative Technology Design. My freshman year, I accidentally went to a lecture that was the wrong class; however, in that lecture, I realized that advertising is a career that is an amalgamation of all the skills and hobbies that I enjoy the most including creative content creation, editing, research and media analysis, and adapting to change.</p>
                <p>I stay involved with activities on campus as a student employee and a member of the executive board for the Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity. I also have previous work and digital experience to aid in the transition of selling to tech-native consumers. Before I graduate, I want to find an industry-related internship, continuously update my industry knowledge with media outlets, gain and maintain meaningful relationships with both professionals and professors, and get experience through coursework exercises on how to complete common marketing tasks. After college, I would like to work for a company in my field of study and continue to obtain knowledge about the advertising business.</p>
                <p>I have an intense passion for <strong>creative</strong> expression through media and communications. I also love connecting with others in the workspace and bouncing fresh ideas around with fellow creatives. I am hard-working, motivated, organized, and a positive person who loves to continually learn and grow.</p>
